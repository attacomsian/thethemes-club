                <p>If there is one name you know in the world of web hosting, it's probably Bluehost. Founded in 1996, Bluehost is
                    <b>known for low-cost shared hosting plans, plus WordPress hosting, VPS, dedicated, and reseller options</b> â€” plus domain registrations.
                    As a company, Bluehost pride themselves on superb customer support (for example, on their website, they boast a call waiting time of less than
                    30 seconds - a bold claim).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bluehost is a good choice if you want <b>100% in-house services</b> from a specialized team. Nothing is outsourced: the company have their own fibre
                    connections, their own data centres spanning 20,000 square feet, and even their own custom Linux kernel running on custom-built servers. This makes them
                    an ideal solution if you prefer to have one point of contact when you need help and support.
